The notebooks include data analysis, model development, and system evaluation using machine learning techniques. This README provides guidance on how to set up and use these notebooks effectively.\n","\n","## Notebooks Description\n","- **data_analysis_1.ipynb:** Focuses on the initial data processing and exploratory data analysis, setting the stage for feature selection and initial insights.\n","- **tensorflow_nn_model.ipynb:** Contains the development of the neural network model, detailing the architecture, training, and initial evaluation stages.\n","- **evaluation_and_validation.ipynb:** Dedicated to the comprehensive testing and validation of the trained model, including performance metrics and sensitivity analysis.\n","\n","## Getting Started\n","\n","### Dependencies\n","Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:\n","- Python 3.8 or later\n","- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab\n","- TensorFlow 2.x\n","- NumPy\n","- Pandas\n","- Matplotlib\n","- Scikit-learn\n","\n","You can install these packages via pip with the following command:\n","```bash\n","pip install notebook tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn\n","```\n","## Installation\n","\n","1.   Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.\n","2.   Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.\n","3.   Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:\n","\n","```bash\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","or\n","\n","```bash\n","jupyter lab\n","```\n","## Usage\n","\n","### General Instructions\n","\n","1.   Open the respective notebook in your Jupyter environment.\n","2.   Run the cells in sequence to avoid runtime errors due to undefined variables.\n","\n","### Making Predictions\n","\n","*   To make predictions based on user input, locate the cell titled 'Make Predictions' in the `tensorflow_nn_model.ipynb` notebook.\n","*   Modify the input variables as per your data. Here is an example of how to change the variables:\n","\n","```python\n","input_data = {\n","    'Direction_of_travel': 'North',\n","    'Day_of_Week': 'Monday',\n","    'Month': 5,\n","    'hour': 15\n","}\n","predict_traffic_volume(model, preprocessor, input_data)\n","```\n","\n","*   Execute the cell to view the predictions.\n","\n","### Customising Models\n","\n","*   To alter the model structure or parameters, edit the sections under 'Model Configuration' in the `tensorflow_nn_model.ipynb` notebook.\n","*   Adjust parameters such as `n_neurons`, `n_layers`, and `epochs` according to your requirements.\n","\n","### Data Analysis\n","\n","*   For data analysis adjustments, go to the `data_analysis_1.ipynb` notebook.\n","*   Modify or add cells to incorporate different types of analysis, such as changing the features being plotted or analysed.\n","\n","## Contributing\n","\n","Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your suggested changes.\n","\n","## Support\n","\n","For support, open an issue through GitHub or contact the repository maintainer via email.\n","\n","## License\n","\n","This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE.md` file for details.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"M9dkTkyR75fa"}}]}
