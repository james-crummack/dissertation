Performance Metrics\n","For regression tasks, the typical metrics include:\n","\n","Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.\n","Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.\n","Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the square root of the mean of the squared errors. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response, and it is the most important criterion for fit if the main purpose of the model is prediction.\n","R-squared (Coefficient of Determination): Provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model, through the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.\n","2. Cross-Validation\n","K-Fold Cross-Validation: This involves dividing the data into\n","�\n","k subsets and iteratively training the model on\n","�\n","−\n","1\n","k−1 subsets while using the remaining subset for testing. This technique helps to ensure that every observation from the original dataset has the chance of appearing in training and test set and is especially useful when dealing with small datasets.\n","Time-Series Cross-Validation: If your data involves a temporal component, traditional random shuffling for cross-validation might not be appropriate. Instead, use techniques like rolling or expanding windows to simulate real-time, chronological evaluations.\n","3. Residual Analysis\n","Plotting Residuals: Residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values) can provide insights into the model's performance across different segments of data. Analyzing residual plots can help diagnose issues like heteroscedasticity or model misspecifications.\n","Autocorrelation of Residuals: Particularly important for time-series models where independence of observations is a key assumption.\n","4. Model Diagnostics\n","Learning Curves: Plotting training and validation loss over epochs can help identify overfitting (if the validation loss starts to increase while training loss continues to decrease).\n","Feature Importance: Understanding which features significantly impact the model can help in refining the model for better performance.\n","5. Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis\n","Noise Resistance: Introduce noise to the inputs during validation to see how the model's predictions are affected. It's crucial for models deployed in real-world conditions where input data might not be perfect.\n","Adversarial Testing: Slightly alter inputs to test the model's sensitivity and robustness to input changes.\n","6. Comparative Analysis\n","Benchmarking: Compare your model's performance against simpler models (like linear regression or decision trees) or against state-of-the-art models if applicable.\n","A/B Testing: If possible, run A/B tests where the current model and the new model run simultaneously in a live environment to compare performance directly under the same conditions."],"metadata":{"id":"DhB6oowhmQtI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### §5 Model evaluation and validation.\n","\n","#### **Performance metrics (5.1)**\n","Our model achieved an RMSE of X, significantly outperforming the baseline model's RMSE of Y.
